# PDF-Reader: A COGS 303 Pilot Project
This project is a Python-based PDF reader designed to help users focus on reading dense text by implementing adaptive features. Since our team does not have access to actual eye-tracking devices, this will serve as the simulation of a pilot user study to determine user needs. 

The key features of this demonstration will include:

- Text Highlighting: Highlights the text currently being read to improve focus and comprehension.
- Blocking Non-Reading Areas: Masks the rest of the text that is not currently being read to minimize distractions.

The application is built using PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project aims to explore methods of preventing skim reading and improving reading comprehension when working with large digital documents.

How to use this demonstration 

- Highlighting text: Choose the "highlight_text_final" class, run the program. Click "Open PDF" and adjust speed and lines revealed accordingly. 
- Blocking text: Choose the "block_text_final" class, run and program. Click "Open PDF" and adjust speed and lines revealed accordingly.
